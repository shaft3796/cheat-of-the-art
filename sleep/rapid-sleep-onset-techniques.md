## üõ†Ô∏è All Techniques

### 1. 4-7-8 Breathing
**Reduces onset by:** 7-10 minutes  
**How:** Inhale nose (4 counts) ‚Üí Hold (7 counts) ‚Üí Exhale mouth (8 counts)  
**Reps:** 4-6 cycles maximum  
**Works by:** Activating parasympathetic nervous system, mild CO2 increase causes drowsiness

### 2. Progressive Muscle Relaxation
**Reduces onset by:** 7 minutes average  
**How:** Tense muscle group 75% for 5 seconds ‚Üí Release suddenly  
**Sequence:** Toes ‚Üí feet ‚Üí calves ‚Üí thighs ‚Üí glutes ‚Üí abdomen ‚Üí chest ‚Üí arms ‚Üí shoulders ‚Üí neck ‚Üí face  
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes total  
**Key:** Don't tense 100% (causes cramping), focus on the contrast when releasing

### 3. Military Method
**Success rate:** 96% after 6 weeks practice  
**Time:** 2 minutes once mastered  
**Steps:**
1. Relax entire face (tongue, jaw, eye muscles)
2. Drop shoulders as low as possible
3. Exhale, relaxing chest
4. Relax legs from thighs to toes
5. Clear mind 10 seconds using ONE image:
   - Black velvet hammock in dark room
   - Canoe on calm lake under blue sky
   - Repeat "don't think, don't think"

### 4. Cognitive Shuffling
**Reduces onset by:** 5-10 minutes  
**How:** Pick neutral 5+ letter word (e.g., GARDEN)  
**Process:** For each letter, think of words starting with it and visualize briefly  
- G: guitar, giraffe, glove (visualize each)
- A: apple, anchor, astronaut
- R: rabbit, rainbow, rocket  
**Key:** Keep images random and unconnected, switch every 3-5 seconds

### 5. Body Scan
**Reduces onset by:** 5-8 minutes  
**How:** Notice sensations from head down in 2-inch segments  
**Duration:** 10-20 minutes full body  
**Key:** Just observe, don't try to relax. If you notice tension, acknowledge it but don't fix it  
**Best for:** Racing thoughts (gives anchor for attention)

### 6. Paradoxical Intention
**Reduces onset by:** 10 minutes  
**How:** Tell yourself to stay awake with eyes closed  
**Implementation:** Lie comfortably, try to resist sleep while remaining still  
**Duration:** Usually works within 15 minutes  
**Best for:** Sleep anxiety ("I MUST fall asleep" pressure)

### 7. Cooling Breath (Sitali)
**Effect:** Triggers 1-2¬∞F body cooling  
**How:** 
- Curl tongue into tube (or purse lips)
- Inhale slowly through tube
- Close mouth, exhale through nose  
**Reps:** 10-15 breaths  
**Works by:** Cooling hypothalamus through roof of mouth

### 8. Extremity Warming
**Reduces onset by:** Up to 15 minutes  
**How:** Wear socks OR hot water bottle at feet (not torso)  
**Alternative:** Visualize warmth flowing to hands/feet  
**Works by:** Peripheral dilation triggers core cooling

### 9. Reverse Day Recall
**How:** Replay your day backwards in boring detail  
**Start:** Getting into bed ‚Üí brushing teeth ‚Üí dinner ‚Üí afternoon ‚Üí lunch ‚Üí morning  
**Key:** Reverse chronology prevents emotional engagement  
**Speed:** Spend 30-60 seconds per hour of your day

### 10. Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)
**How:** 
1. Feel body sinking into mattress
2. Count backwards from 100
3. Say "deeper and heavier" between numbers
4. Lose count? Start at 100 again  
**Benefit:** Produces Stage 1 sleep brainwaves even if awake

‚Ä¢ **Switching techniques too fast**  Give each 5+ minutes
‚Ä¢ **Tensing muscles 100%**  Increases arousal
‚Ä¢ **Forcing sleep**  Creates performance pressure
