## ðŸ“‹ Detailed Breakdown - The 80%

### Consistent sleep/wake schedule (Â±30min daily, including weekends)
Suprachiasmatic nucleus requires regularity for optimal melatonin secretion. Social jet lag (weekend variation >1hr) equivalent to flying across 2 time zones weekly. Consistency matters more than duration - better to sleep 7hrs consistently than 6-9hrs variably.

### Morning bright light: 10,000 lux Ã— 30min within 60min of waking
Suppresses melatonin, triggers cortisol awakening response, sets circadian clock. Cloudy day=1,000 lux (need 2hrs), sunny day=100,000 lux (5min sufficient). Indoor light typically 100-500 lux (insufficient). Light therapy box or direct sunlight required.

### Bedroom temperature: 60-67Â°F (15-19Â°C)
Core body temp must drop 2-3Â°F to initiate sleep. Cold room + warm blankets optimal. Heat is #1 sleep disruptor in summer. Feet/hands warm, core cool. Partners may need separate blankets for individual regulation.

### Complete darkness (<1 lux) - blackout curtains + eye mask
Even 5-10 lux (nightlight level) suppresses melatonin 50%. LED lights on electronics disrupt sleep even through closed eyelids. Cover all lights with tape. Phone face-down or outside room. Darkness triggers melatonin 2hrs before natural bedtime.

### No caffeine after 12pm (half-life 5-7 hours)
Quarter-life 10-14hrs means 25% active at midnight from 2pm coffee. Blocks adenosine receptors preventing sleep pressure. Individual variation: slow metabolizers (CYP1A2 gene variant) need 8am cutoff. Includes tea, chocolate, pre-workouts, sodas.

### No screens 1hr before bed OR blue-blockers (<530nm wavelength)
Blue light suppresses melatonin 2x more than other wavelengths. Screens at 12in distance = 200 lux directly to retina. Orange/red glasses must block 100% below 530nm (check specifications). f.lux/Night Shift insufficient - only reduces 20-30%.

### 7-9 hour sleep opportunity every night
Sleep efficiency 85% means 8hrs in bed = 6.8hrs actual sleep. Chronic 6hr sleep = 2 nights total deprivation cognitively. <7hrs increases mortality 12%, obesity 23%, diabetes 28%. >9hrs may indicate depression, inflammation, or sleep quality issues.

ðŸ”¬ Detailed Breakdown - The 20%

### Hot bath/shower 90min before bed (not immediately before)
Raises body temp 1-2Â°F, then rapid cooling mimics natural circadian temp drop. Immediately before bed prevents cooling. Studies show 10min faster sleep onset, 15% more deep sleep. Water temp 104-109Â°F (40-43Â°C) optimal.

### Exercise finished 90min+ before sleep
Elevates core temp 1-2Â°F for 4-6hrs. Morning exercise advances circadian phase (earlier sleepiness). Evening exercise okay if moderate intensity. HIIT/strength training need 3hr buffer. Increases deep sleep 15-20% regardless of timing.

### No alcohol within 4hrs of bedtime
Fragments sleep architecture, suppresses REM 20-50%. Rebound REM in second half causes vivid dreams/awakenings. Each drink takes 60-90min to metabolize. "Nightcap" myth - sedation â‰  sleep. Wine with dinner (6pm) okay for 10pm bedtime.

### No food 3hrs before bed
Insulin spike opposes melatonin. Digestion raises core temp 0.5-1Â°F. GERD risk increased 35% eating <3hrs before bed. Late eating shifts circadian clock backwards. Exception: 150cal high-glycemic snack may help if truly hungry.

### 4-7-8 breathing in bed (4 inhale, 7 hold, 8 exhale)
Activates parasympathetic nervous system, reduces heart rate 5-10bpm. Based on pranayama yoga. 4 cycles maximum. Alternative: Box breathing (4-4-4-4) or coherent breathing (5 breaths/min). Reduces sleep onset from 15min to 8min average.

### Power naps: 10-20min only, before 3pm
10min improves alertness 2hrs. 20min includes Stage 2 sleep for memory. 30min+ causes sleep inertia (grogginess) from interrupted deep sleep. 90min allows full cycle but disrupts night sleep. After 3pm interferes with adenosine buildup.

### Magnesium glycinate: 200-400mg, 30-60min before bed
60% adults deficient. Activates GABA receptors, blocks NMDA (excitatory). Glycinate form crosses blood-brain barrier best. Start 200mg, increase gradually. Citrate causes diarrhea. Threonate alternative for cognition. Improves deep sleep 20%.

### Evening lights <40 lux after sunset
Equivalent to 5-6 candles. Salt lamps=10 lux, TV from 10ft=50 lux. Red light (630-700nm) doesn't suppress melatonin. Smart bulbs on timer. Bathroom light for nighttime = red nightlight only. Each 100 lux evening exposure delays sleep 30min.

### White/pink noise machine (consistent 60dB)
Masks environmental sounds preventing microarousals. Pink noise synchronized to brain waves increases deep sleep 23%. Volume like moderate rainfall. NOT ocean waves (variable = alerting). Phone apps inferior to dedicated machines (speaker quality).

### Morning protein within 30min of waking
20-40g protein stabilizes cortisol awakening response. Prevents 10am energy crash. Advances food-based circadian signaling. Tryptophan from protein converts to serotonin then melatonin (16hr process). Skip if intermittent fasting unless sleep issues.

### Sleep debt tracking and planned recovery
1hr debt needs 1.3hrs recovery sleep (not 1:1). Maximum effective recovery: 10hrs/night Ã— 3 nights. Weekend recovery only 25% effective for cognitive restoration. Track weekly average, not daily. Apps overestimate sleep by 30min average.
