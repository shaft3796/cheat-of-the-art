## ‚è∞ Core Timing Principles

### **Optimal Sleep Windows**
‚Ä¢ **Adults (18-64):** 7-9 hours of actual sleep needed
‚Ä¢ **Sleep efficiency:** If you achieve 85% efficiency, you need 9.5hrs in bed to get 8hrs sleep
‚Ä¢ **Natural sleepy times:** Your body wants to sleep 10pm-12am and nap 2pm-4pm
‚Ä¢ **Sleep hormone starts:** Melatonin naturally releases around 9-10pm (makes you drowsy)
‚Ä¢ **Natural wake time:** Cortisol naturally peaks 6-8am (makes you alert)

### **The Non-Negotiable Rule**
**WAKE TIME IS SACRED** - Never vary wake time more than ¬±30 minutes, even if you slept poorly

## üìä Sleep Debt Management

### **Debt Accumulation**
‚Ä¢ **<6hrs sleep:** Accumulating 2+ hours debt/night
‚Ä¢ **6-7hrs sleep:** Accumulating 0.5-1 hour debt/night  
‚Ä¢ **Debt ceiling:** After 10 days, performance plateaus at 30% reduced

### **Debt Recovery Formulas**
‚Ä¢ **Acute debt (<1 week):** Requires 1.3x recovery ratio
  - 5hrs debt = 6.5hrs extra sleep needed over 2-3 nights
‚Ä¢ **Chronic debt (>1 week):** Requires 1.5-2x recovery ratio
  - 10hrs debt = 15-20hrs extra sleep over 7-10 nights

### **Recovery Protocols**
**Weekend Recovery (for 5hrs weekly debt):**
- Fri: Bed 30min earlier, wake 30min later (+1hr)
- Sat: Bed 1hr earlier, wake 1hr later (+2hrs)  
- Sun: Bed 45min earlier, wake normal time (+45min)
- Total: 3.75hrs recovery for 5hrs debt

**If you can't fall asleep:** Get up after 20min, do quiet activity, try again when sleepy. Don't extend next night's sleep to "make up" for tonight's miss.

**If you wake up early:** Stay in bed with eyes closed until target time. If impossible, get up but keep next night's bedtime the same.

**Vacation Recovery (for chronic debt):**
- Days 1-3: Sleep until natural wake (no alarm)
- Days 4-7: 9hrs opportunity
- Day 8+: Resume target schedule

## üîÑ Schedule Shifting Protocols

### **Advancing Schedule (Going to Bed Earlier)**
**Rate:** Maximum 30min/day sustainable
```
Current: Sleep 12am-8am ‚Üí Target: Sleep 10pm-6am
Day 1-2: Bed 11:30pm, Wake 7:30am (force wake with alarm)
Day 3-4: Bed 11pm, Wake 7am
Day 5-6: Bed 10:30pm, Wake 6:30am
Day 7: Bed 10pm, Wake 6am
```

**If you can't fall asleep:** Stay in bed for 30min max, then get up for 20min and retry. Keep tomorrow's wake time fixed.

### **Delaying Schedule (Going to Bed Later)**
**Rate:** Can do 1-2hrs/day easily
```
Current: Sleep 10pm-6am ‚Üí Target: Sleep 12am-8am
Day 1: Bed 11pm, Wake 7am
Day 2: Bed 12am, Wake 8am
```

### **Jet Lag Formula**
‚Ä¢ **Flying East:** 1 day recovery per timezone crossed
‚Ä¢ **Flying West:** 0.5 days recovery per timezone crossed
‚Ä¢ **Strategy:** Adopt destination schedule immediately upon arrival

---

## üéØ Nap Timing Strategy

### **Power Nap Windows**
‚Ä¢ **Best time:** 1pm-3pm (natural afternoon dip)
‚Ä¢ **Duration:** 10-20 minutes only
‚Ä¢ **Latest nap:** 3pm (later disrupts night sleep)
‚Ä¢ **If sleep debt >2hrs:** 90-minute nap allowed (one full cycle)

### **Strategic Napping**
‚Ä¢ **Night shift prep:** 90min nap 7-9pm
‚Ä¢ **All-nighter recovery:** 20min every 4hrs
‚Ä¢ **Jet lag:** Nap at destination's 2pm only

---

## üíä Timing Interventions

### **When to Take Recovery Sleep**
‚Ä¢ **1 bad night (<5hrs):** Keep normal schedule, 20min nap allowed
‚Ä¢ **2 bad nights:** Bed 1hr earlier for next 2 nights
‚Ä¢ **3+ bad nights:** Use sleep extension protocol (below)

### **Sleep Extension Protocol**
```
Night 1-2: Bed 2hrs earlier (8pm if normally 10pm)
Night 3-4: Bed 1hr earlier (9pm)
Night 5+: Return to normal schedule
```

**Can't fall asleep early?** Lie in bed anyway for "rest state" - still beneficial. Don't check phone or clock.

### **Sleep Restriction Protocol (for chronic insomnia)**
```
Week 1: Limit to 5hrs only (1am-6am)
Week 2: Add 15min (12:45am-6am)
Week 3: Add 15min (12:30am-6am)
Continue adding 15min weekly until 85% efficiency
```

**Wake up middle of night?** No phone/clock checking. If awake >20min, get up and read until sleepy.

## üö® Crisis Scenarios - Quick Solutions

### **Scenario: Party until 5am, work tomorrow**

**Option A - Only 2hrs sleep available:**
- Sleep 5am-7am (set 5 alarms)
- Work day (30-40% capacity)
- Bed 8pm tonight (10hrs recovery)
- If can't sleep at 5am: Skip sleep, micro-naps only

**Option B - 5hrs sleep available:**
- Sleep 5am-10am straight
- Work day (70% capacity)
- Normal 10pm bedtime tonight
- If wake at 8am: Stay in bed, rest until 10am

**Option C - No work constraints:**
- Sleep 5am-noon (7hrs)
- 20min nap at 4pm (not later)
- Bed 11pm (gradual shift back)

### **Scenario: Shifting from midnight to 10pm bedtime (vacation return)**
```
Days 1-2: Force wake 7:30am regardless of when you fell asleep
Days 3-4: Wake 7am, attempt bed 11:30pm
Days 5-6: Wake 6:30am, attempt bed 11pm
Day 7: Target achieved (10pm-6am)
```

**Can't fall asleep at new time?** Normal - stay in bed for rest. Body adjusts in 3-4 days.

### **Scenario: Summer heat delays sleep**
- **Keep 6am wake** (absolutely non-negotiable)
- **Shift bedtime 30min earlier** (9:30pm) as buffer
- **Accept temporary sleep loss** (builds pressure for next night)
- **Weekend:** 1hr extra recovery allowed Saturday only

**Still can't fall asleep?** Don't extend morning sleep. The mild restriction will help next night.

### **Scenario: Accumulating 30min debt nightly**
**Weekday micro-adjustments:**
- Wake 6:10am instead of 6am (+10min)
- Thursday 20min power nap at lunch
- Friday bed 9:30pm (+30min)

**Weekend recovery:**
- Sat: Bed 9pm, wake 7am (10hrs)
- Sun: Bed 9:45pm, wake 6am (8.25hrs)

**Can't sleep extra on weekend?** Focus on consistency instead - debt stabilizes after 2 weeks.

## üìê Quick Reference Formulas

### **Sleep Pressure Reset (Nuclear Option)**
- Stay awake 36-40hrs straight
- Sleep at target bedtime
- Instant schedule reset (brutal but effective)
- Only use 1-2x per year maximum

### **Minimum Sleep for Safety**
- <4hrs: Don't drive or make important decisions
- 4-5hrs: 50% cognitive capacity
- 5-6hrs: 70% cognitive capacity  
- 6-7hrs: 85% cognitive capacity
- 7-8hrs: 95% cognitive capacity

### **Recovery Night Timing**
- Debt ‚â§2hrs: Normal bedtime
- Debt 2-4hrs: Bed 1hr earlier
- Debt 4-6hrs: Bed 2hrs earlier
- Debt >6hrs: Need multiple nights (can't recover in one)

### **The 3-Day Rule**
Any schedule disruption must be corrected within 3 days or it becomes your new pattern

### **Weekend Catch-up Limits**
- Maximum useful: +2hrs Friday, +2hrs Saturday
- Sunday: Must return to within 1hr of weekday schedule
- Never sleep past 10am (destroys Sunday night sleep)

3. Sleep 6pm-6am (12hr opportunity)
4. Return to normal schedule next day
5. **Can't sleep at 6pm?** Try 7pm, 8pm, but no later than 9pm

### **"I have rotating shifts"**
- Forward rotation only (days‚Üíevening‚Üínight)
- Minimum 2 days between rotation changes

- Return to bed only when sleepy
- Wake at same time regardless
- No naps to compensate
- If chronic: Use sleep restriction protocol above

### **"I keep waking at 3am"**
- No clock checking (increases anxiety)
- Stay in bed, eyes closed
- If awake >30min: Get up, boring activity
- No phone/screens
- Consider if room too hot/cold
- Wake at normal time even if tired
